task 1
What type of programming experience?
I have only coded in with-in the carriculum my school has provided me. So i have 
experience in web programming, some arduino, mostly taught code in c#.

What have you done with controllers, which ones have you used?
i have used Arduino in my IOT module in school
which single board computers do you know/have you used? 

i only know of Rasperry pi
Who is a maker or part of a maker community?
i am not pat or a maker community. i have made some circuits before.

What do you already know about IoT?
I did a module at school for about 2 or 3 weeks so guess i know a few basics like
how devices communicate using the internet or other networks.

what are your expectations to this class?
i expect to learn enough to complete what we want to complete on our global 
minor project

task 2
What does IoT entail?
The internet of things tells us about a network of physical devices built with 
software and sensors in order to communicate with each other over the internet

3 domains
health care
there are wearable devices we have today that help a lot of patients monitor that
may want to monitor their vitals, like heart rate monitor cuffs, and fitness bands

smart cities
imagine having an app on your phone that tells you what parking spaces are free 
in the middle of a busy city, well with sensors built on the ground of parking
spots this app will be able to do just that. these are just one of many smart city 
solutions you can expect with IoT applications

Agriculture
for the perfect crops to be grown, one must always take into account the 
environment in which these crops grow. the humidity, air temperature, and soil 
quality. with some sensors all these things can be measured.


2 commonly used data protocols 
Two of the most commonly used IOT data protocols are Bluetooth and WiFi

2 typical devices
two of the most commonly used IoT devices include smart watches and smart tvs

task 3 

domain added
smart home system, smart self driving vehicles, smart manufacturing and retail, 
smart transport and mobility, Smart energy,

devices added
smart lawn mower, smart vacum cleaner, smart kitchen appliances, phones

benefits
-you can interact with your home apppliances from anywhere. like if you need to 
preheat the oven you can do so on your way home
-you can track equipment in real time which could be important in the hospital
where every second may count.
-enterprises can share data more efficiently through their devices
-avoiding costs as it predicts problems before they happen
-automation

challenges
-my thoughts on the 1st video were concerns of security, with this digital error
criminals are smarter and have smarter ways to take advantage of us an with 
everything becoming connected to the internet it feels like more and more 
options are created for criminals to exploit citizens.
-growh is slower than expected due to the complexity of the application.
-who will pay for the different IoT solutions

task 4 hardware
why esp8266?
it is cheap and easily programmable

what is personally inspiring for you?
im not really that interested in buildng hardware as much as software so nothing
really to be honest.

what is the connection to coffee?
has the same prefix as the espresso
